**Traffic Sign Recognition**


In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark:https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Our benchmark has the following properties:

Single-image, multi-class classification problem More than 40 classes More than 50,000 images in total Large, lifelike database Acknowledgements
